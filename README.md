# shared-witnesses
Some members of the Web of Trust community share KERI witnesses with one another as a way to construct witness pools that are immune from an eclipse attack. See https://bit.ly/3T622PT.

## Participation
You can use these shared witnesses if you are willing to contribute a witness of your own. The more witnesses, the better our collective protections.

To contribute, please raise a PR against this repo. Your PR should add your signature to the [Participation Agreement](agreement.md), and add your witness(es) to the [Registry](registry.md).

If you wish to stop participating, please raise a PR that removes your signature and your witnesses.
