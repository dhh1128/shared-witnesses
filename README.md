# shared-witnesses
Some members of the Web of Trust community share KERI witnesses with one another as a way to construct witness pools that are immune from an eclipse attack. See [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yk08OyAQGOVi9TlKIrkx7-hfm2AcI78LzDfAKiwNngE/present?usp=sharing).

## Participation
You can use these shared witnesses if you are willing to contribute a witness of your own. The more witnesses, the better our collective protections.

To contribute, please raise a PR against this repo. Your PR should add your signature to the [Participation Agreement](agreement.md), and add your witness(es) to the [Registry](registry.md).

If you wish to stop participating, please raise a PR that removes your signature and your witnesses.
